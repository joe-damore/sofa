# Sofa
Build-it-yourself HTPC frontend

## Overview
Sofa is a build-it-yourself frontend for home theather PCs (HTPCs) and kiosks.

## Development

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Node.js
- Yarn

### Bootstrapping
Before you can build or run Sofa, you must install Node.js dependencies and build the tools and libraries upon which Sofa relies.

This process can be expedited by running the following command in the root Sofa directory:

```bash
$ yarn bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command may take a few minutes to execute. It is equivalent to executing `yarn install && yarn build` in each child Sofa project directory.
